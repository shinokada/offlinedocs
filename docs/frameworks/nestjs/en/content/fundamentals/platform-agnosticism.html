This means you can develop <strong>reusable logical parts</strong> that can be used across different types of applications. For example, most components can be re-used without change across different underlying HTTP server frameworks (e.g., Express and Fastify), and even across different <em>types</em> of applications (e.g., HTTP server frameworks, Microservices with different transport layers, and Web Sockets).<section id="build-once-use-everywhere"class="level4"><h4>Build once, use everywhere</h4><p>The <strong>Overview</strong> section of the documentation primarily shows coding techniques using HTTP server frameworks (e.g., apps providing a REST API or providing an MVC-style server-side rendered app). However, all those building blocks can be used on top of different transport layers (<a href="/microservices/basics">microservices</a> or <a href="/websockets/gateways">websockets</a>).<p>Furthermore, Nest comes with a dedicated <a href="/graphql/quick-start">GraphQL</a> module. You can use GraphQL as your API layer interchangeably with providing a REST API.<p>In addition, the <a href="/application-context">application context</a> feature helps to create any kind of Node.js application - including things like CRON jobs and CLI apps - on top of Nest.<p>Nest aspires to be a full-fledged platform for Node.js apps that brings a higher-level of modularity and reusability to your applications.
