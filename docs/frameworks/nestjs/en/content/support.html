This framework is a result of the long road, full of sleepless nights, working <strong>after hours</strong>, and busy weekends.<section id="how-can-you-help"class="level4"><h4>How can you help?</h4><p>Nest doesn't have a large company that sits behind and is continuously paying for hours spent on the development. I fully rely on the <strong>goodness</strong> ❤️ of the people. However, I would love to make this framework even more <strong>powerful</strong>, to be fully focused on delivering you great solutions that make coding process enjoyable: In order to help me, I run few supporting platforms:<ul><li>become a backer or sponsor on <a href="https://opencollective.com/nest">OpenCollective</a><li>use <a href="https://paypal.me/kamilmysliwiec">PayPal</a> to send a one-time donation<li>or reach me directly: <a href="mailto:mail@kamilmysliwiec.com">mail@kamilmysliwiec.com</a></ul><p>If you fell in love with Nest, or you run a business which is using Nest, consider sponsoring its development to ensure that the project which your product relies on is <strong>actively maintained</strong> and improved. Also, your support could help me to work more on content that benefits whole Nest community, writing either educational blog posts or recording videos. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
