It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).<p>Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> (the default) and optionally can be configured to use <a href="https://github.com/fastify/fastify">Fastify</a> as well!<p>Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.<section id="philosophy"class="level4"><h4>Philosophy</h4><p>In recent years, thanks to Node.js, JavaScript has become the “lingua franca” of the web for both front and backend applications. This has given rise to awesome projects like <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue">Vue</a>, which improve developer productivity and enable the creation of fast, testable, and extensible frontend applications. However, while plenty of superb libraries, helpers, and tools exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem of - <strong>Architecture</strong>.<p>Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by Angular.</section><section id="installation"class="level4"><h4>Installation</h4><p>To get started, you can either scaffold the project with the <a href="/cli/overview">Nest CLI</a>, or clone a starter project (both will produce the same outcome).<p>To scaffold the project with the Nest CLI, run the following commands. This will create a new project directory, and populate the directory with the initial core Nest files and supporting modules, creating a conventional base structure for your project. Creating a new project with the <strong>Nest CLI</strong> is recommended for first-time users. We'll continue with this approach in <a href="first-steps">First Steps</a>.<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">npm</span> i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name</code></pre><blockquote><p>info <strong>Hint</strong> To create a new project with TypeScript's <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict">strict</a> mode enabled, pass the <code>--strict</code> flag to the <code>nest new</code> command.</blockquote></section><section id="alternatives"class="level4"><h4>Alternatives</h4><p>Alternatively, to install the TypeScript starter project with <strong>Git</strong>:<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">git</span> clone https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter.git project
$ <span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> project
$ <span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span>
$ <span class="token function">npm</span> run start</code></pre><blockquote><p>info <strong>Hint</strong> If you'd like to clone the repository without the git history, you can use <a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit">degit</a>.</blockquote><p>Open your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/"><code>http://localhost:3000/</code></a>.<p>To install the JavaScript flavor of the starter project, use <code>javascript-starter.git</code> in the command sequence above.<p>You can also manually create a new project from scratch by installing the core and supporting files with <strong>npm</strong> (or <strong>yarn</strong>). In this case, of course, you'll be responsible for creating the project boilerplate files yourself.<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">npm</span> i --save @nestjs/core @nestjs/common rxjs reflect-metadata</code></pre><p><span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
