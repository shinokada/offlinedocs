        <h2>Saving disk space and boosting installation speed</h2>

          When using npm, if you have 100 projects using a dependency, you will
          have 100 copies of that dependency saved on disk. With pnpm, the dependency will be
          stored in a content-addressable store, so:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you depend on different versions of the dependency, only the files that
            differ are added to the store. For instance, if it has 100 files, and a new
            version has a change in only one of those files, <code>pnpm update</code> will only add 1
            new file to the store, instead of cloning the entire dependency just for the
            singular change.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the files are saved in a single place on the disk. When packages are
            installed, their files are hard-linked from that single place, consuming no
            additional disk space. This allows you to share dependencies of the same version
            across projects.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As a result, you save a lot of space on your disk proportional to the number of
          projects and dependencies, and you have a lot faster installations!

        <h2>Creating a non-flat node_modules directory</h2>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/xiaokedada/status/1471691763102679041/photo/1"><img src="/img/node-modules-structure.jpg"></a>)</p>
        <p>
          When installing dependencies with npm or Yarn Classic, all packages are hoisted to the root of the
          modules directory. As a result, source code has access to dependencies that are
          not added as dependencies to the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, pnpm uses symlinks to add only the direct dependencies of the project into the root of the modules directory.
          If you'd like more details about the unique <code>node_modules</code> structure that pnpm
          creates and why it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read:

        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>If your tooling doesn't work well with symlinks, you may still use pnpm and set the <a href="npmrc#node-linker">node-linker</a> setting to <code>hoisted</code>. This will instruct pnpm to create a node_modules directory that is similar to those created by npm and Yarn Classic.</p>
