Unlike pnpm, npm can install the same <code>name@version</code> multiple times and with different sets of dependencies. npm's lockfile is designed to reflect the flat <code>node_modules</code> layout, however, as pnpm creates an isolated layout by default, it cannot respect npm's lockfile format. See <a href="cli/import.html)">pnpm import</a> if you wish to convert a lockfile to pnpm's format, though.<li>Binstubs (files in <code>node_modules/.bin</code>) are always shell files, not symlinks to JS files. The shell files are created to help pluggable CLI apps in finding their plugins in the unusual <code>node_modules</code> structure. This is very rarely an issue and if you expect the file to be a JS file, reference the original file directly instead, as described in [#736].</ol><p>Got an idea for workarounds for these issues? <a href="https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/new">Share them.</a>)<p><a href="https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/736">#736</a> <span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section>
