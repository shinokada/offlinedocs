      <h1>Limitations</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <code>npm-shrinkwrap.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code> are ignored. Unlike pnpm, npm
          can install the same <code>name@version</code> multiple times and with different sets of
          dependencies. npm's lockfile is designed to reflect the flat <code>node_modules</code>
          layout, however, as pnpm creates an isolated layout by default, it cannot respect
          npm's lockfile format. See <a href="cli/import.html)">pnpm import</a> if you wish to convert a lockfile to
          pnpm's format, though.
        </li>
        <li>
          Binstubs (files in <code>node_modules/.bin</code>) are always shell files, not
          symlinks to JS files. The shell files are created to help pluggable CLI apps
          in finding their plugins in the unusual <code>node_modules</code> structure. This is very
          rarely an issue and if you expect the file to be a JS file, reference the
          original file directly instead, as described in [#736].

        Got an idea for workarounds for these issues?
