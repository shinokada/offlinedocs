This can be done either manually or using the <code>pnpm -r update</code> command.<p><a href="workspaces.html">workspace protocol</a></section><section id="err_pnpm_peer_dep_issues"class="level2"><h2>ERR_PNPM_PEER_DEP_ISSUES</h2><p><code>pnpm install</code> will fail if the project has unresolved peer dependencies or the peer dependencies are not matching the wanted ranges. To fix this, install the missing peer dependencies.<p>You may also selectively ignore these errors using the <a href="package_json.html">pnpm.peerDependencyRules.ignoreMissing</a> and <a href="package_json.html">pnpm.peerDependencyRules.allowedVersions</a> fields in <code>package.json</code>.</section><section id="err_pnpm_outdated_lockfile"class="level2"><h2>ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE</h2><p>This error happens when installation cannot be performed without changes to the lockfile. This might happen in a CI environment if someone has changed a <code>package.json</code> file in the repository without running <code>pnpm install</code> afterwards. Or someone forgot to commit the changes to the lockfile.<p>To fix this error, just run <code>pnpm install</code> and commit the changes to the lockfile.</section><section id="err_pnpm_tarball_integrity"class="level2"><h2>ERR_PNPM_TARBALL_INTEGRITY</h2><p>This error indicates that the downloaded package's tarball did not match the expected integrity checksum.<p>If you use the npm registry (<code>registry.npmjs.org</code>), then this probably means that the integrity in your lockfile is incorrect. This might happen if a lockfile had badly resolved merge conflicts.<p>If you use a registry that allows to override existing versions of a package, then it might mean that in your local metadata cache you have the integrity checksum of an older version of the package. In this case, you should run <code>pnpm store prune</code>. This command will remove your local metadata cache. Then you can retry the command that failed.<p>But also be careful and verify that the package is downloaded from the right URL. The URL should be printed in the error message. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
