This is for a multitude of reasons, the primary of which being:<ul><li>it enables faster installation for CI and production environments, due to being able to skip package resolution<li>it enforces consistent installations and resolution between development, testing, and production environments, meaning the packages used in testing and production will be exactly the same as when you developed your project</ul><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="merge-conflicts"><h3 id="merge-conflicts">Merge conflicts</h3><p>pnpm can automatically resolve merge conflicts in <code>pnpm-lock.yaml</code>. If you have conflicts, just run <code>pnpm install</code> and commit the changes.<p>Be warned, however. It is advised that you review the changes prior to staging a commit, because we cannot guarantee that pnpm will choose the correct head - it instead builds with the most updated of lockfiles, which is ideal in most cases. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section></section>
