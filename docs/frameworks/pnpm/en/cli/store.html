            Functionally equivalent to [<code>pnpm add</code>], except this adds new packages to the
            store directly without modifying any projects or files outside of the store.

          <h3>prune</h3>
          <p>Removes <em>unreferenced packages</em> from the store.</p>
          <p>
            Unreferenced packages are packages that are not used by any projects on the
            system. Packages can become unreferenced after most installation operations, for
            instance when dependencies are made redundant.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, during <code>pnpm install</code>, package <code>foo@1.0.0</code> is updated to
            <code>foo@1.0.1</code>. pnpm will keep <code>foo@1.0.0</code> in the store, as it does not
            automatically remove packages. If package <code>foo@1.0.0</code> is not used by any other
            project on the system, it becomes unreferenced. Running <code>pnpm store prune</code> would
            remove <code>foo@1.0.0</code> from the store.
          </p>
          <p>
            Running <code>pnpm store prune</code> is not harmful and has no side effects on your
            projects. If future installations require removed packages, pnpm will download
            them again.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is best practice to run <code>pnpm store prune</code> occasionally to clean up the
            store, but not too frequently. Sometimes, unreferenced packages become required
            again. This could occur when switching branches and installing older
            dependencies, in which case pnpm would need to re-download all removed packages,
            briefly slowing down the installation process.
