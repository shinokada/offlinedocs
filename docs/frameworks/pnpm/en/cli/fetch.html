RUN curl -f https://get.pnpm.io/v6.16.js | node - add --global pnpm

CMD [ node, server.js ]</code></pre><p>It works for both simple and monorepo projects, <code>--offline</code> enforces pnpm not to communicate with the package registry as all needed packages are already present in the virtual store.<p>As long as the lockfile is not changed, the build cache is valid up to the layer, so <code>RUN pnpm install -r --offline --prod</code>, will save you much time.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="options"><h2 id="options">Options</h2><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="--dev"><h3 id="--dev">--dev</h3><p>Only development packages will be fetched</section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="--prod"><h3 id="--prod">--prod</h3><p>Development packages will not be fetched<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/">official guide</a> <span style="float:footnote"><a href="../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section></section>
