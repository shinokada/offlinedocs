|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # all the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- providers         # all of the application providers
|
+-- routes            # routes configuration
|
+-- stores            # global state stores
|
+-- test              # test utilities and mock server
|
+-- types             # base types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions</code></pre><p>In order to scale the application in the easiest and most maintainable way, keep most of the code inside the <code>features</code> folder, which should contain different feature-based things. Every <code>feature</code> folder should contain domain specific code for a given feature. This will allow you to keep functionalities scoped to a feature and not mix its declarations with shared things. This is much easier to maintain than a flat folder structure with many files.<p>A feature could have the following structure:<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- routes      # route components for a specific feature pages
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types for TS specific feature domain
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
|
+-- index.ts    # entry point for the feature, it should serve as the public API of the given feature and exports everything that should be used outside the feature</code></pre><p>Everything from a feature should be exported from the <code>index.ts</code> file which behaves as the public API of the feature.<p>You should import stuff from other features only by using:<p><code>import {AwesomeComponent} from "@/features/awesome-feature"</code><p>and not<p><code>import {AwesomeComponent} from "@/features/awesome-feature/components/AwesomeComponent</code><p>This can also be configured in the ESLint configuration to disallow the later import by the following rule:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token literal-property property">rules</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token string-property property">'no-restricted-imports'</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>
            <span class="token string">'error'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
            <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
                <span class="token literal-property property">patterns</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'@/features/*/*'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
            <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>

    <span class="token comment">// ...rest of the configuration</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>This was inspired by how <a href="https://nx.dev/">NX</a> handles libraries that are isolated but available to be used by the other modules. Think of a feature as a library or a module that is self-contained but can expose different parts to other features via its entry point. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section>
