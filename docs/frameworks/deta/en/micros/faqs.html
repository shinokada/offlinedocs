This limit includes the total size of your code and dependencies.</section><section id="why-does-my-micro-behave-different-locally-and-deployed"class="level3"><h3>Why does my Micro behave different locally and deployed?</h3><p>This can be because of a number of reasons. Please check out the <a href="https://docs.deta.sh/docs/micros/about#technical-specifications">specifications</a> and <a href="https://docs.deta.sh/docs/micros/about#important-notes">notes</a> for further information to find a possible reason.</section><section id="why-is-my-micro-returning-a-502-bad-gateway"class="level3"><h3>Why is my Micro returning a 502 Bad Gateway?</h3><p>The response comes from a reverse proxy between a client and your Micro. If there is a runtime error or a timeout when invoking a Micro, the proxy responds with a <code>502 Bad Gateway.</code><p>In order to debug <code>502</code> responses, you can use <code>deta visor</code> which show you real-time logs of your application. Navigate to your Micro's visor page from the UI or use the deta cli command <code>deta visor open</code> to view the error logs.<p>If there are no logs in your visor and your Micro's response took roughly 10 seconds, then it's likely because of a timeout.<p>If it is not because of a timeout, then please contact us.</section><section id="is-it-safe-to-commit-the-deta-folder-created-by-the-cli"class="level3"><h3>Is it safe to commit the <code>.deta</code> folder created by the cli?</h3><p>Yes it is safe to commit your <code>.deta</code> folder and push it to public repositories. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section>
