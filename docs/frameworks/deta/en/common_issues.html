We are sorry for this and will push a fix as soon as we can.<p>As a workaround, please add the environment variable <code>BINARY_CONTENT_TYPES={file_mime_type}</code> in the micro's environment to serve the file. The <code>file_mime_type</code> can accept wildcards (<code>*</code>) and comma separated values.<p>For instance, if you want to serve images and fonts from your nodejs micro, setting<pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">BINARY_CONTENT_TYPES=image/*,font/*</code></pre><p>will let the micro serve these files.<p>Please, use the <a href="https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/commands#deta-update"><code>deta update -e [env_file_name]</code></a> command to update the environment variables of the Micro.</section><section id="cannot-login-from-the-web-browser-after-deta-login"class="level3"><h3>Cannot login from the web browser after <code>deta login</code></h3><p>If logging in with <code>deta login</code> from the <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser</a> fails, disable the shields for that page and try again.
