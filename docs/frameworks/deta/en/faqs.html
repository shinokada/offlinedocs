A project key will be created for you when you create a project, and you can manage all of a project's keys from the <em>'Project Keys'</em> option in any project's sidebar. If this key is leaked, the data stored in any of the connected project's Bases and Drives can be compromised.<li><p><strong>API Keys</strong>: API Keys are optional keys to protect your Micro HTTP endpoint or to implement client-based rules. Creating API Keys from the Deta CLI is described <a href="/docs/cli/commands#deta-auth-create-api-key">here</a>. Read more about API Keys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key">here</a>. If this key is leaked, your Micro's http endpoint can be used by unwanted clients.<li><p><strong>Access Tokens</strong>: Access tokens are used for authenticating the Deta CLI. Use cases: CI/CD, Gitpod, GitHub Actions. Information on Deta Access Tokens can be found <a href="/docs/cli/auth#deta-access-tokens">here</a>. If this key is leaked, your whole Deta account is compromised.</ol><p>These types of keys are not unique to Deta; all other cloud providers use some variant of them.</section><section id="can-i-delete-a-project"class="level3"><h3>Can I delete a project?</h3><p>No, sorry but deleting projects is not available yet.<span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section>
