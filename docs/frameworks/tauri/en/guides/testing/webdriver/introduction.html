Tooling that is dedicated to it, such as [tauri-driver], is still in active development and may change as necessary over time. Additionally, only Windows and Linux are currently supported.<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">WebDriver</a> is a standardized interface to interact with web documents primarily intended for automated testing. Tauri supports the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">WebDriver</a> interface by leveraging the native platform's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">WebDriver</a> server underneath a cross-platform wrapper <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tauri-driver"><code>tauri-driver</code></a>.<section id="system-dependencies"class="level2"><h2>System Dependencies</h2><p>Install the latest <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tauri-driver"><code>tauri-driver</code></a> or update an existing installation by running:<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">cargo <span class="token function">install</span> tauri-driver</code></pre><p>Because we currently utilize the platform's native <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/">WebDriver</a> server, there are some requirements for running <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tauri-driver"><code>tauri-driver</code></a> on supported platforms. Platform support is currently limited to Linux and Windows.<section id="linux"class="level3"><h3>Linux</h3><p>We use <code>WebKitWebDriver</code> on Linux platforms. Check if this binary exists already (command <code>which WebKitWebDriver</code>) as some distributions bundle it with the regular WebKit package. Other platforms may have a separate package for them, such as <code>webkit2gtk-driver</code> on Debian-based distributions.</section><section id="windows"class="level3"><h3>Windows</h3><p>Make sure to grab the version of <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">Microsoft Edge Driver</a> that matches your Windows Edge version that the application is being built and tested on. This should almost always be the latest stable version on up-to-date Windows installs. If the two versions do not match, you may experience your WebDriver testing suite hanging while trying to connect.<p>The download contains a binary called <code>msedgedriver.exe</code>. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tauri-driver"><code>tauri-driver</code></a> looks for that binary in the <code>$PATH</code> so make sure it's either available on the path or use the <code>--native-driver</code> option on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tauri-driver"><code>tauri-driver</code></a>. You may want to download this automatically as part of the CI setup process to ensure the Edge, and Edge Driver versions stay in sync on Windows CI machines. A guide on how to do this may be added at a later date.</section></section><section id="example-application"class="level2"><h2>Example Application</h2><p>The <a href="example/setup">next section</a> of the guide shows step-by-step how to create a minimal example application that is tested with WebDriver.<p>If you prefer to see the result of the guide and look over a finished minimal codebase that utilizes it, you can look at <a href="https://github.com/chippers/hello_tauri">https://github.com/chippers/hello_tauri</a>. That example also comes with a CI script to test with GitHub actions, but you may still be interested in the <a href="ci">WebDriver CI</a> guide as it explains the concept a bit more.<p><span style="float:footnote"><a href="../../../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section>
