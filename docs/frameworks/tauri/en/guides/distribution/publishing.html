Build Your Web App</h3><p>Now that you are ready to package your project, you need to run your framework's or bundler's build command (assuming you're using one, of course).<blockquote><p>Every framework has its publishing tooling. It is outside of the scope of this document to treat them all or keep them up to date.</blockquote></section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="2-bundle-your-application-with-tauri"><h3 id="2-bundle-your-application-with-tauri">2. Bundle your application with Tauri</h3><command name="build"><p>This command embeds your web assets into a single binary with your Rust code. The binary itself will be located in <code>src-tauri/target/release/[app name]</code>, and installers will be located in <code>src-tauri/target/release/bundle/</code>.<p>Like the <code>tauri dev</code> command, the first time you run this, it takes some time to collect the Rust crates and build everything - but on subsequent runs, it only needs to rebuild your app's code, which is much quicker. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="../../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></command></section></section>
