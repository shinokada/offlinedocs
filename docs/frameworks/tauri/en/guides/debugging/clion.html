CLion may not recognize Cargo projects that are not at the top-level, in which case you should be able to attach it by using <code>Cargo -> Attach Cargo project</code>. If this option does not work, you will need to create a top-level Workspace that just points to the main <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:<figure class="language-toml"><figcaption>Cargo.toml</figcaption><pre class="language-toml"><code class="language-toml"><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token table class-name">workspace</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>
<span class="token key property">members</span> <span class="token punctuation">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>src-tauri<span class="token punctuation">]</span></code></pre></figure><p>Before you proceed, make sure that your project is fully loaded. If the indexing is finished and the Cargo tool window shows all the modules and targets of the workspace, you’re good to go.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="rundebug-configuration"><h2 id="rundebug-configuration">Run/Debug Configuration</h2><p>We will set up a Run/Debug configuration that we can use to launch our Tauri app in debugging mode. To create a configuration, go to Edit Configurations, click <strong>+</strong>, and then select Cargo Command.<p><img src="/img/guides/debugging/clion/add-cargo-config-light.png#gh-light-mode-only"alt="Add Run/Debug Configuration"> <img src="/img/guides/debugging/clion/add-cargo-config-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only"alt="Add Run/Debug Configuration"><p>With that created we need to configure CLion so it instructs Cargo to build our app without any default features. This will tell Tauri to use your development server instead of reading assets from disk. Normally this flag is passed by the Tauri CLI, but since we're completely sidestepping that here, we need to pass the flag manually.<p><img src="/img/guides/debugging/clion/set-no-default-features-light.png#gh-light-mode-only"alt="Add &#x60;--no-default-features&#x60; flag"> <img src="/img/guides/debugging/clion/set-no-default-features-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only"alt="Add &#x60;--no-default-features&#x60; flag"><p>Now we can optionally rename the Run/Debug Configuration to something more memorable, in this example we called it Run Tauri App, but you can name it whatever you want.<p><img src="/img/guides/debugging/clion/rename-configuration-light.png#gh-light-mode-only"alt="Rename Configuration"> <img src="/img/guides/debugging/clion/rename-configuration-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only"alt="Rename Configuration"></p>caution<p>On Windows you must also make sure that CLion uses the correct debugger toolchain. To do this, open the Settings (<code>File -> Settings...</code>), select <code>Build, Execution, Deployment -> Toolchains</code> and move the <code>Visual Studio</code> toolchain to the top.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="launch-the-development-server"><h2 id="launch-the-development-server">Launch the Development Server</h2><p>The above configuration will use Cargo directly to build the Rust application and attach the debugger to it. This means we completely sidestep the Tauri CLI, so features like the <code>beforeDevCommand</code> and <code>beforeBuildCommand</code> will <strong>not</strong> be executed. We need to take care of that by opening a new Terminal and starting running the development server manually:<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">pnpm vite dev</code></pre><blockquote><p>Note that CLion currently has no support for background tasks in Run/Debug configurations like VS Code has, so for now you need to manually run the development server.</blockquote></section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="launch-a-debugging-session"><h2 id="launch-a-debugging-session">Launch a Debugging Session</h2><p>With the development server running and the Run/Debug Configuration selected in the Switcher, you can now start a new debugging session by clicking Debug. CLion will automatically recognize breakpoints placed in any Rust file in your project.<p><span style="float:footnote"><a href="../../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
