We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new features as soon as their design is close to final--similar to how Meta uses React internally. We are introducing a new officially supported Canary release channel. It lets curated setups like frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release schedule.</p></blogcard><blogcard title="React Labs: What We&#x27;ve Been Working On – March 2023"date="March 22, 2023"url="/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023"><p>In React Labs posts, we write about projects in active research and development.

Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights.
