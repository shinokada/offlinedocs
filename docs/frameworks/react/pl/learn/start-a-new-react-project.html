As your JavaScript bundle grows with every new feature, you might have to figure out how to split code for every route individually. As your data fetching needs get more complex, you are likely to encounter server-client network waterfalls that make your app feel very slow. As your audience includes more users with poor network conditions and low-end devices, you might need to generate HTML from your components to display content early--either on the server, or during the build time. Changing your setup to run some of your code on the server or during the build can be very tricky.<p><strong>These problems are not React-specific. This is why Svelte has SvelteKit, Vue has Nuxt, and so on.</strong> To solve these problems on your own, you'll need to integrate your bundler with your router and with your data fetching library. It's not hard to get an initial setup working, but there are a lot of subtleties involved in making an app that loads quickly even as it grows over time. You'll want to send down the minimal amount of app code but do so in a single client–server roundtrip, in parallel with any data required for the page. You'll likely want the page to be interactive before your JavaScript code even runs, to support progressive enhancement. You may want to generate a folder of fully static HTML files for your marketing pages that can be hosted anywhere and still work with JavaScript disabled. Building these capabilities yourself takes real work.<p><strong>React frameworks on this page solve problems like these by default, with no extra work from your side.</strong> They let you start very lean and then scale your app with your needs. Each React framework has a community, so finding answers to questions and upgrading tooling is easier. Frameworks also give structure to your code, helping you and others retain context and skills between different projects. Conversely, with a custom setup it's easier to get stuck on unsupported dependency versions, and you'll essentially end up creating your own framework—albeit one with no community or upgrade path (and if it's anything like the ones we've made in the past, more haphazardly designed).<p>If you're still not convinced, or your app has unusual constraints not served well by these frameworks and you'd like to roll your own custom setup, we can't stop you--go for it! Grab <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code> from npm, set up your custom build process with a bundler like <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> or <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a>, and add other tools as you need them for routing, static generation or server-side rendering, and more.</section></deepdive></section></section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="bleeding-edge-react-frameworks-bleeding-edge-react-frameworks"><h2 id="bleeding-edge-react-frameworks-bleeding-edge-react-frameworks">Bleeding-edge React frameworks {/<em>bleeding-edge-react-frameworks</em>/}</h2><p>As we've explored how to continue improving React, we realized that integrating React more closely with frameworks (specifically, with routing, bundling, and server technologies) is our biggest opportunity to help React users build better apps. The Next.js team has agreed to collaborate with us in researching, developing, integrating, and testing framework-agnostic bleeding-edge React features like <a href="/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components">React Server Components.</a><p>These features are getting closer to being production-ready every day, and we've been in talks with other bundler and framework developers about integrating them.

This lets you mix build-time, server-only, and interactive components in a single React tree.<p>For example, you can write a server-only React component as an <code>async</code> function that reads from a database or from a file. Then you can pass data down from it to your interactive components:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// This component runs *only* on the server (or during the build).</span>
<span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function"><span class="token maybe-class-name">Talks</span></span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> confId <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><p>Next.js's App Router also integrates <a href="/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#suspense-in-data-frameworks">data fetching with Suspense</a>. This lets you specify a loading state (like a skeleton placeholder) for different parts of your user interface directly in your React tree:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token operator">&#x3C;</span><span class="token maybe-class-name">Suspense</span> fallback<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token operator">&#x3C;</span><span class="token maybe-class-name">TalksLoading</span> <span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token operator">></span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token operator">></span>

<span class="token operator">&#x3C;</span><span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token maybe-class-name">Suspense</span><span class="token operator">></span></code></pre><p>Server Components and Suspense are React features rather than Next.js features. However, adopting them at the framework level requires buy-in and non-trivial implementation work. At the moment, the Next.js App Router is the most complete implementation. The React team is working with bundler developers to make these features easier to implement in the next generation of frameworks.</p><span style="float:footnote"><a href="../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></deepdive></section></section></section>
