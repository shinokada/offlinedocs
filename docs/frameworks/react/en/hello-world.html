Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.<blockquote><p>Tip<p>This guide is designed for people who prefer <strong>learning concepts step by step</strong>. If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our <a href="/tutorial/tutorial.html">practical tutorial</a>. You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.</blockquote><p>This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you're reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.<p>Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. <strong>You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.</strong> For example, <a href="./introducing-jsx.html">“Introducing JSX”</a> is the next chapter after this one.</section><section id="knowledge-level-assumptions"class="level2"><h2>Knowledge Level Assumptions</h2><p>React is a JavaScript library, and so we'll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. <strong>If you don't feel very confident, we recommend <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">going through a JavaScript tutorial</a> to check your knowledge level</strong> and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won't have to feel like you're learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.<blockquote><p>Note<p>This guide occasionally uses some newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven't worked with JavaScript in the last few years, <a href="https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c">these three points</a> should get you most of the way.</blockquote></section><section id="lets-get-started"class="level2"><h2>Let's Get Started!</h2><p>Keep scrolling down, and you'll find the link to the <a href="./introducing-jsx.html">next chapter of this guide</a> right before the website footer.<p><span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
