      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>
      <pre class="language-jsx"><code class="language-jsx"><span class="token keyword">const</span> root <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">ReactDOM</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">createRoot</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token dom variable">document</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">getElementById</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'root'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
root<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">render</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token plain-text">Hello, world!</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
      <p>It displays a heading saying "Hello, world!" on the page.</p>

        <h2>How to Read This Guide</h2>
        <p>In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Tip</p>
          <p>This guide is designed for people who prefer <strong>learning concepts step by step</strong>. If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our <a href="/tutorial/tutorial.html">practical tutorial</a>. You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you're reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.</p>
        <p>Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. <strong>You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.</strong> For example, <a href="./introducing-jsx.html">“Introducing JSX”</a> is the next chapter after this one.</p>

      <section id="knowledge-level-assumptions" class="level2">
        <h2>Knowledge Level Assumptions</h2>
        <p>React is a JavaScript library, and so we'll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. <strong>If you don't feel very confident, we recommend <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">going through a JavaScript tutorial</a> to check your knowledge level</strong> and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won't have to feel like you're learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Note</p>
          <p>This guide occasionally uses some newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven't worked with JavaScript in the last few years, <a href="https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c">these three points</a> should get you most of the way.</p>
