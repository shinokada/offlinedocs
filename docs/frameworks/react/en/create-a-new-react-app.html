You’ll need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6</a> on your machine. To create a project, run:<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">npx create-react-app my-app
<span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> my-app
<span class="token function">npm</span> start</code></pre><blockquote><p>Note<p><code>npx</code> on the first line is not a typo -- it's a <a href="https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b">package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+</a>.</blockquote><p>Create React App doesn't handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a>, but you don't need to know anything about them.<p>When you're ready to deploy to production, running <code>npm run build</code> will create an optimized build of your app in the <code>build</code> folder.

It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them.<li><p>A <strong>bundler</strong>, such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> or <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a>. It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.<li><p>A <strong>compiler</strong> such as <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>.
