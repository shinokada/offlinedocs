The recommended <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app"><code>eslint-config-react-app</code></a> preset already includes them.</section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="formatting-formatting"><h3 id="formatting-formatting">Formatting {/<em>formatting</em>/}</h3><p>The last thing you want to do when sharing your code with another contributor is get into an discussion about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tabs+vs+spaces">tabs vs spaces</a>! Fortunately, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> will clean up your code by reformatting it to conform to preset, configurable rules. Run Prettier, and all your tabs will be converted to spacesâ€”and your indentation, quotes, etc will also all be changed to conform to the configuration. In the ideal setup, Prettier will run when you save your file, quickly making these edits for you.<p>You can install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier extension in VSCode</a> by following these steps:<ol><li>Launch VS Code<li>Use Quick Open (press Ctrl/Cmd+P)<li>Paste in <code>ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode</code><li>Press Enter</ol><section class="level4"aria-labelledby="formatting-on-save-formatting-on-save"><h4 id="formatting-on-save-formatting-on-save">Formatting on save {/<em>formatting-on-save</em>/}</h4><p>Ideally, you should format your code on every save. VS Code has settings for this!<ol><li>In VS Code, press <code>CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P</code>.<li>Type "settings"<li>Hit Enter<li>In the search bar, type "format on save"<li>Be sure the "format on save" option is ticked!</ol><blockquote><p>If your ESLint preset has formatting rules, they may conflict with Prettier. We recommend disabling all formatting rules in your ESLint preset using <a href="https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier"><code>eslint-config-prettier</code></a> so that ESLint is <em>only</em> used for catching logical mistakes. If you want to enforce that files are formatted before a pull request is merged, use <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html#--check"><code>prettier --check</code></a> for your continuous integration. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></blockquote></section></section></section></section>
