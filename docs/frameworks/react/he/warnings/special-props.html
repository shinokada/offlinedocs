If you need to access the same value within the child component, you should pass it as a different prop (ex: <code>&#x3C;ListItemWrapper key={result.id} id={result.id} /></code> and read <code>props.id</code>). While this may seem redundant, it's important to separate app logic from hints to React. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section>
