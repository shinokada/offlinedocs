Many of them exist for historical reasons and might change with time.<section id="top-level-folders"class="level3"><h3>Top-Level Folders</h3><p>After cloning the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React repository</a>, you will see a few top-level folders in it:<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages"><code>packages</code></a> contains metadata (such as <code>package.json</code>) and the source code (<code>src</code> subdirectory) for all packages in the React repository. <strong>If your change is related to the code, the <code>src</code> subdirectory of each package is where you'll spend most of your time.</strong><li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/fixtures"><code>fixtures</code></a> contains a few small React test applications for contributors.<li><code>build</code> is the build output of React. It is not in the repository but it will appear in your React clone after you <a href="./how-to-contribute.html#development-workflow">build it</a> for the first time.</ul><p>The documentation is hosted <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org">in a separate repository from React</a>.<p>There are a few other top-level folders but they are mostly used for the tooling and you likely won't ever encounter them when contributing.</section><section id="colocated-tests"class="level3"><h3>Colocated Tests</h3><p>We don't have a top-level directory for unit tests. Instead, we put them into a directory called <code>__tests__</code> relative to the files that they test.<p>For example, a test for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/87724bd87506325fcaf2648c70fc1f43411a87be/src/renderers/dom/client/utils/setInnerHTML.js"><code>setInnerHTML.js</code></a> is located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/87724bd87506325fcaf2648c70fc1f43411a87be/src/renderers/dom/client/utils/__tests__/setInnerHTML-test.js"><code>__tests__/setInnerHTML-test.js</code></a> right next to it.</section><section id="warnings-and-invariants"class="level3"><h3>Warnings and Invariants</h3><p>The React codebase uses <code>console.error</code> to display warnings:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword control-flow">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>__DEV__<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

You can think about it as making an assertion.<p>It is important to keep development and production behavior similar, so <code>invariant</code> throws both in development and in production. The error messages are automatically replaced with error codes in production to avoid negatively affecting the byte size.</section><section id="development-and-production"class="level3"><h3>Development and Production</h3><p>You can use <code>__DEV__</code> pseudo-global variable in the codebase to guard development-only blocks of code.<p>It is inlined during the compile step, and turns into <code>process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'</code> checks in the CommonJS builds.<p>For standalone builds, it becomes <code>true</code> in the unminified build, and gets completely stripped out with the <code>if</code> blocks it guards in the minified build.<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword control-flow">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>__DEV__<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

Its repository contains multiple separate packages so that their changes can be coordinated together, and issues live in one place.</section><section id="react-core"class="level3"><h3>React Core</h3><p>The "core" of React includes all the <a href="./react-api.html#react">top-level <code>React</code> APIs</a>, for example:<ul><li><code>React.createElement()</code><li><code>React.Component</code><li><code>React.Children</code></ul><p><strong>React core only includes the APIs necessary to define components.</strong> It does not include the <a href="./reconciliation.html">reconciliation</a> algorithm or any platform-specific code. It is used both by React DOM and React Native components.<p>The code for React core is located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react"><code>packages/react</code></a> in the source tree. It is available on npm as the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react"><code>react</code></a> package. The corresponding standalone browser build is called <code>react.js</code>, and it exports a global called <code>React</code>.</section><section id="renderers"class="level3"><h3>Renderers</h3><p>React was originally created for the DOM but it was later adapted to also support native platforms with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>. This introduced the concept of "renderers" to React internals.<p><strong>Renderers manage how a React tree turns into the underlying platform calls.</strong><p>Renderers are also located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/"><code>packages/</code></a>:<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-dom">React DOM Renderer</a> renders React components to the DOM. It implements <a href="./react-dom.html">top-level <code>ReactDOM</code> APIs</a> and is available as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom"><code>react-dom</code></a> npm package. It can also be used as standalone browser bundle called <code>react-dom.js</code> that exports a <code>ReactDOM</code> global.<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-native-renderer">React Native Renderer</a> renders React components to native views. It is used internally by React Native.<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-test-renderer">React Test Renderer</a> renders React components to JSON trees. It is used by the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html">Snapshot Testing</a> feature of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest">Jest</a> and is available as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-test-renderer">react-test-renderer</a> npm package.</ul><p>The only other officially supported renderer is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-art"><code>react-art</code></a>. It used to be in a separate <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-art">GitHub repository</a> but we moved it into the main source tree for now.<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong><p>Technically the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-native-renderer"><code>react-native-renderer</code></a> is a very thin layer that teaches React to interact with React Native implementation. The real platform-specific code managing the native views lives in the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native">React Native repository</a> together with its components.</blockquote></section><section id="reconcilers"class="level3"><h3>Reconcilers</h3><p>Even vastly different renderers like React DOM and React Native need to share a lot of logic. In particular, the <a href="./reconciliation.html">reconciliation</a> algorithm should be as similar as possible so that declarative rendering, custom components, state, lifecycle methods, and refs work consistently across platforms.<p>To solve this, different renderers share some code between them. We call this part of React a "reconciler". When an update such as <code>setState()</code> is scheduled, the reconciler calls <code>render()</code> on components in the tree and mounts, updates, or unmounts them.<p>Reconcilers are not packaged separately because they currently have no public API. Instead, they are exclusively used by renderers such as React DOM and React Native.</section><section id="stack-reconciler"class="level3"><h3>Stack Reconciler</h3><p>The "stack" reconciler is the implementation powering React 15 and earlier. We have since stopped using it, but it is documented in detail in the <a href="./implementation-notes.html">next section</a>.</section><section id="fiber-reconciler"class="level3"><h3>Fiber Reconciler</h3><p>The "fiber" reconciler is a new effort aiming to resolve the problems inherent in the stack reconciler and fix a few long-standing issues. It has been the default reconciler since React 16.<p>Its main goals are:<ul><li>Ability to split interruptible work in chunks.<li>Ability to prioritize, rebase and reuse work in progress.<li>Ability to yield back and forth between parents and children to support layout in React.<li>Ability to return multiple elements from <code>render()</code>.<li>Better support for error boundaries.</ul><p>You can read more about React Fiber Architecture <a href="https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.ag-grid.com/inside-fiber-an-in-depth-overview-of-the-new-reconciliation-algorithm-in-react">here</a>. While it has shipped with React 16, the async features are not enabled by default yet.<p>Its source code is located in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-reconciler"><code>packages/react-reconciler</code></a>.</section><section id="event-system"class="level3"><h3>Event System</h3><p>React implements a layer over native events to smooth out cross-browser differences.
