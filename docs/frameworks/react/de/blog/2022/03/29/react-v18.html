We think this is largely true for application developers, though the story may be a bit more complicated for library maintainers.<p>Concurrency is not a feature, per se. It's a new behind-the-scenes mechanism that enables React to prepare multiple versions of your UI at the same time. You can think of concurrency as an implementation detail — it's valuable because of the features that it unlocks. React uses sophisticated techniques in its internal implementation, like priority queues and multiple buffering. But you won't see those concepts anywhere in our public APIs.<p>When we design APIs, we try to hide implementation details from developers. As a React developer, you focus on <em>what</em> you want the user experience to look like, and React handles <em>how</em> to deliver that experience. So we don’t expect React developers to know how concurrency works under the hood.<p>However, Concurrent React is more important than a typical implementation detail — it's a foundational update to React's core rendering model. So while it's not super important to know how concurrency works, it may be worth knowing what it is at a high level.<p>A key property of Concurrent React is that rendering is interruptible. When you first upgrade to React 18, before adding any concurrent features, updates are rendered the same as in previous versions of React — in a single, uninterrupted, synchronous transaction. With synchronous rendering, once an update starts rendering, nothing can interrupt it until the user can see the result on screen.<p>In a concurrent render, this is not always the case. React may start rendering an update, pause in the middle, then continue later. It may even abandon an in-progress render altogether. React guarantees that the UI will appear consistent even if a render is interrupted. To do this, it waits to perform DOM mutations until the end, once the entire tree has been evaluated. With this capability, React can prepare new screens in the background without blocking the main thread. This means the UI can respond immediately to user input even if it’s in the middle of a large rendering task, creating a fluid user experience.<p>Another example is reusable state. Concurrent React can remove sections of the UI from the screen, then add them back later while reusing the previous state. For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to restore the previous screen in the same state it was in before. In an upcoming minor, we're planning to add a new component called <code>&#x3C;Offscreen></code> that implements this pattern. Similarly, you’ll be able to use Offscreen to prepare new UI in the background so that it’s ready before the user reveals it.<p>Concurrent rendering is a powerful new tool in React and most of our new features are built to take advantage of it, including Suspense, transitions, and streaming server rendering. But React 18 is just the beginning of what we aim to build on this new foundation.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="gradually-adopting-concurrent-features-gradually-adopting-concurrent-features"><h2 id="gradually-adopting-concurrent-features-gradually-adopting-concurrent-features">Gradually Adopting Concurrent Features {/<em>gradually-adopting-concurrent-features</em>/}</h2><p>Technically, concurrent rendering is a breaking change. Because concurrent rendering is interruptible, components behave slightly differently when it is enabled.<p>In our testing, we've upgraded thousands of components to React 18. What we've found is that nearly all existing components "just work" with concurrent rendering, without any changes. However, some of them may require some additional migration effort. Although the changes are usually small, you'll still have the ability to make them at your own pace. The new rendering behavior in React 18 is <strong>only enabled in the parts of your app that use new features.</strong><p>The overall upgrade strategy is to get your application running on React 18 without breaking existing code. Then you can gradually start adding concurrent features at your own pace. You can use <a href="/reference/react/StrictMode"><code>&#x3C;StrictMode></code></a> to help surface concurrency-related bugs during development. Strict Mode doesn't affect production behavior, but during development it will log extra warnings and double-invoke functions that are expected to be idempotent. It won't catch everything, but it's effective at preventing the most common types of mistakes.<p>After you upgrade to React 18, you’ll be able to start using concurrent features immediately. For example, you can use startTransition to navigate between screens without blocking user input. Or useDeferredValue to throttle expensive re-renders.<p>However, long term, we expect the main way you’ll add concurrency to your app is by using a concurrent-enabled library or framework. In most cases, you won’t interact with concurrent APIs directly. For example, instead of developers calling startTransition whenever they navigate to a new screen, router libraries will automatically wrap navigations in startTransition.<p>It may take some time for libraries to upgrade to be concurrent compatible. We’ve provided new APIs to make it easier for libraries to take advantage of concurrent features. In the meantime, please be patient with maintainers as we work to gradually migrate the React ecosystem.<p>For more info, see our previous post: <a href="/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide">How to upgrade to React 18</a>.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="suspense-in-data-frameworks-suspense-in-data-frameworks"><h2 id="suspense-in-data-frameworks-suspense-in-data-frameworks">Suspense in Data Frameworks {/<em>suspense-in-data-frameworks</em>/}</h2><p>In React 18, you can start using <a href="/reference/react/Suspense">Suspense</a> for data fetching in opinionated frameworks like Relay, Next.js, Hydrogen, or Remix. Ad hoc data fetching with Suspense is technically possible, but still not recommended as a general strategy.<p>In the future, we may expose additional primitives that could make it easier to access your data with Suspense, perhaps without the use of an opinionated framework. However, Suspense works best when it’s deeply integrated into your application’s architecture: your router, your data layer, and your server rendering environment. So even long term, we expect that libraries and frameworks will play a crucial role in the React ecosystem.<p>As in previous versions of React, you can also use Suspense for code splitting on the client with React.lazy. But our vision for Suspense has always been about much more than loading code — the goal is to extend support for Suspense so that eventually, the same declarative Suspense fallback can handle any asynchronous operation (loading code, data, images, etc).</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="server-components-is-still-in-development-server-components-is-still-in-development"><h2 id="server-components-is-still-in-development-server-components-is-still-in-development">Server Components is Still in Development {/<em>server-components-is-still-in-development</em>/}</h2><p><a href="/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components"><strong>Server Components</strong></a> is an upcoming feature that allows developers to build apps that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering. Server Components is not inherently coupled to Concurrent React, but it’s designed to work best with concurrent features like Suspense and streaming server rendering.<p>Server Components is still experimental, but we expect to release an initial version in a minor 18.x release. In the meantime, we’re working with frameworks like Next.js, Hydrogen, and Remix to advance the proposal and get it ready for broad adoption.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="whats-new-in-react-18-whats-new-in-react-18"><h2 id="whats-new-in-react-18-whats-new-in-react-18">What's New in React 18 {/<em>whats-new-in-react-18</em>/}</h2><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="new-feature-automatic-batching-new-feature-automatic-batching"><h3 id="new-feature-automatic-batching-new-feature-automatic-batching">New Feature: Automatic Batching {/<em>new-feature-automatic-batching</em>/}</h3><p>Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance.

Otherwise they feel "wrong". However, transitions are different because the user doesn’t expect to see every intermediate value on screen.<p>For example, when you select a filter in a dropdown, you expect the filter button itself to respond immediately when you click. However, the actual results may transition separately. A small delay would be imperceptible and often expected. And if you change the filter again before the results are done rendering, you only care to see the latest results.<p>Typically, for the best user experience, a single user input should result in both an urgent update and a non-urgent one. You can use startTransition API inside an input event to inform React which updates are urgent and which are "transitions":<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> startTransition <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">'react'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

This lets us build higher-level features on top of it.<p>We introduced a limited version of Suspense several years ago. However, the only supported use case was code splitting with React.lazy, and it wasn't supported at all when rendering on the server.<p>In React 18, we've added support for Suspense on the server and expanded its capabilities using concurrent rendering features.<p>Suspense in React 18 works best when combined with the transition API. If you suspend during a transition, React will prevent already-visible content from being replaced by a fallback. Instead, React will delay the render until enough data has loaded to prevent a bad loading state.<p>For more, see the RFC for <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md">Suspense in React 18</a>.</section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="new-client-and-server-rendering-apis-new-client-and-server-rendering-apis"><h3 id="new-client-and-server-rendering-apis-new-client-and-server-rendering-apis">New Client and Server Rendering APIs {/<em>new-client-and-server-rendering-apis</em>/}</h3><p>In this release we took the opportunity to redesign the APIs we expose for rendering on the client and server.

For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to immediately show the previous screen. To do this, React would unmount and remount trees using the same component state as before.<p>This feature will give React apps better performance out-of-the-box, but requires components to be resilient to effects being mounted and destroyed multiple times. Most effects will work without any changes, but some effects assume they are only mounted or destroyed once.<p>To help surface these issues, React 18 introduces a new development-only check to Strict Mode. This new check will automatically unmount and remount every component, whenever a component mounts for the first time, restoring the previous state on the second mount.<p>Before this change, React would mount the component and create the effects:<pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">* React mounts the component.
