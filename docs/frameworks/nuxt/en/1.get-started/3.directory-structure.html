      <h1>Directory Structure</h1>
      <p>The default Nuxt application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both small and large applications. You are free to organize your application however you like and can create other directories as and when you need them.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Let's create the directories and files that do not exist in our project yet.</p>
      <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">mkdir</span> components assets static
<span class="token function">touch</span> nuxt.config.js</code></pre>
      <p>These are the main directories and files that we use when building a Nuxt application. You will find an explanation of each of them below.</p>
      <section id="info" class="level4">
        <h4>Info</h4>
        <p>Creating directories with these names enables features in your Nuxt project.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="directories" class="level2">
        <h2>Directories</h2>
        <section id="the-pages-directory" class="level3">
          <h3>The pages directory</h3>
          <p>The <code>pages</code> directory contains your application's views and routes. As you've learned in the last chapter, Nuxt reads all the <code>.vue</code> files inside this directory and uses them to create the application router.</p>
          <section id="next" class="level4">
            <h4>Next</h4>
            <p>Learn more about the <a href="./directory-structure/pages">pages directory</a></p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section id="the-components-directory" class="level3">
          <h3>The components directory</h3>
          <p>The <code>components</code> directory is where you put all your Vue.js components which are then imported into your pages.</p>
          <p>With Nuxt you can create your components and auto import them into your .vue files meaning there is no need to manually import them in the script section. Nuxt will scan and auto import these for you once you have components set to true.</p>
          <section id="next-1" class="level4">
            <h4>Next</h4>
            <p>Learn more about the <a href="./directory-structure/components">components directory</a></p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section id="the-assets-directory" class="level3">
          <h3>The assets directory</h3>
          <p>The <code>assets</code> directory contains your uncompiled assets such as your styles, images, or fonts.</p>
          <section id="next-2" class="level4">
            <h4>Next</h4>
            <p>Learn more about the <a href="./directory-structure/assets">assets directory</a></p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section id="the-static-directory" class="level3">
          <h3>The static directory</h3>
          <p>The <code>static</code> directory is directly mapped to the server root and contains files that have to keep their names (e.g. <code>robots.txt</code>) <em>or</em> likely won't change (e.g. the favicon)</p>
          <section id="next-3" class="level4">

          </section>
        </section>
        <section id="the-nuxtconfigjs-file" class="level3">
          <h3>The nuxt.config.js file</h3>
          <p>The <code>nuxt.config.js</code> file is the single point of configuration for Nuxt. If you want to add modules or override default settings, this is the place to apply the changes.</p>
          <section id="next-4" class="level4">

      </section>
      <section id="more-about-the-project-structures" class="level2">
        <h2>More about the project structures</h2>
        <p>There are more helpful directories and files, including <a href="./directory-structure/content">content</a>, <a href="./directory-structure/layouts">layouts</a>, <a href="./directory-structure/middleware">middleware</a>, <a href="./directory-structure/modules">modules</a>, <a href="./directory-structure/plugins">plugins</a> and <a href="./directory-structure/store">store</a> . As they aren't necessary for small applications, they are not covered here.</p>
