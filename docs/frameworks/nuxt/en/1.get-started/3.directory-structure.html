Nuxt will scan and auto import these for you once you have components set to true.<section class="level4"aria-labelledby="next-1"><h4 id="next-1">Next</h4><p>Learn more about the <a href="./directory-structure/components">components directory</a></section></section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="the-assets-directory"><h3 id="the-assets-directory">The assets directory</h3><p>The <code>assets</code> directory contains your uncompiled assets such as your styles, images, or fonts.<section class="level4"aria-labelledby="next-2"><h4 id="next-2">Next</h4><p>Learn more about the <a href="./directory-structure/assets">assets directory</a></section></section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="the-static-directory"><h3 id="the-static-directory">The static directory</h3><p>The <code>static</code> directory is directly mapped to the server root and contains files that have to keep their names (e.g. <code>robots.txt</code>) <em>or</em> likely won't change (e.g. the favicon)<section class="level4"aria-labelledby="next-3"><h4 id="next-3">Next</h4><p>Learn more about the <a href="./directory-structure/static">static directory</a></section></section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="the-nuxtconfigjs-file"><h3 id="the-nuxtconfigjs-file">The nuxt.config.js file</h3><p>The <code>nuxt.config.js</code> file is the single point of configuration for Nuxt.
