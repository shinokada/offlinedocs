It is dynamically generated and hidden by default. Inside the directory you can find automatically generated files when using <code>nuxt dev</code> or your build artifacts when using <code>nuxt build</code>. Modifying these files is great for debugging but remember that they are generated files and once you run the <code>dev</code> or <code>build</code> command again, anything that was saved here will be regenerated.<hr><section class="level4"aria-labelledby="warning"><h4 id="warning">Warning</h4><p>The <code>.nuxt</code> directory should not be committed to your version control system and should be ignored through your <code>.gitignore</code> as it will be generated automatically when executing <code>nuxt dev</code> or <code>nuxt build</code>.</section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="the-builddir-property"><h3 id="the-builddir-property">The buildDir Property</h3><p>By default, many tools assume that <code>.nuxt</code> is a hidden directory, because its name starts with a dot. You can use the buildDir option to prevent that. If you do change the name remember to add the new name to your <code>.gitignore</code> file.<pre class="language-js{}[nuxt.config.js]"><code class="language-js{}[nuxt.config.js]">export default {

It also contains the nuxt-build-indicator which is the page we see when your application is building and nuxt-loading which is your loading component that gets seen when we are waiting for your page to load. You will also find the nuxt-error page in here which contains the Nuxt default error page.<li>The mixins folder has the files needed for the Nuxt <code>$fetch</code> method.<li>The views folder contains your app template and your server error page.<li>The app.js is your main application file.<li>The client.js file is your client file needed for everything that happens client side.<li>The empty file is intentionally left empty for no-op aliases<li>The index.js file bootstraps your application.<li>The loading.html is the file that is used when the page is loading.<li>The middleware file is where your middleware is kept<li>The server.js file is all the code that is ran on the server<li>the utilities contains the utilities that Nuxt needs for it to work.</ul></section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="deploying"><h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3><p>The <code>.nuxt</code> folder is part of the files needed to deploy your SSR application. It is not needed for deploying your static Nuxt app though because we use the <code>dist</code> folder for that. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
