      <h1>Nuxt build directory</h1>
      <p>The <code>.nuxt</code> directory is the so-called <em>build directory</em>. It is dynamically generated and hidden by default. Inside the directory you can find automatically generated files when using <code>nuxt dev</code> or your build artifacts when using <code>nuxt build</code>. Modifying these files is great for debugging but remember that they are generated files and once you run the <code>dev</code> or <code>build</code> command again, anything that was saved here will be regenerated.</p>

      <section id="warning" class="level4">
        <h4>Warning</h4>
        <p>The <code>.nuxt</code> directory should not be committed to your version control system and should be ignored through your <code>.gitignore</code> as it will be generated automatically when executing <code>nuxt dev</code> or <code>nuxt build</code>.</p>

        <h3>The buildDir Property</h3>
        <p>By default, many tools assume that <code>.nuxt</code> is a hidden directory, because its name starts with a dot. You can use the buildDir option to prevent that. If you do change the name remember to add the new name to your <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>

        <h3>Inside the .nuxt folder:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The router.js file is the generated router file that Nuxt generates for you when you put <code>.vue</code> files inside the pages folder. You can use this file for debugging for when you want to look up which routes are generated for vue-router and find out the names of a specific route.</li>
          <li>The router.scrollBehavior.js which is your Router ScrollBehavior</li>
          <li>The Components folder has all your Nuxt components such as NuxtChild and NuxtLink. It also contains the nuxt-build-indicator which is the page we see when your application is building and nuxt-loading which is your loading component that gets seen when we are waiting for your page to load. You will also find the nuxt-error page in here which contains the Nuxt default error page.</li>
          <li>The mixins folder has the files needed for the Nuxt <code>$fetch</code> method.</li>
          <li>The views folder contains your app template and your server error page.</li>
          <li>The app.js is your main application file.</li>
          <li>The client.js file is your client file needed for everything that happens client side.</li>
          <li>The empty file is intentionally left empty for no-op aliases</li>
          <li>The index.js file bootstraps your application.</li>
          <li>The loading.html is the file that is used when the page is loading.</li>
          <li>The middleware file is where your middleware is kept</li>
          <li>The server.js file is all the code that is ran on the server</li>
          <li>the utilities contains the utilities that Nuxt needs for it to work.</li>

        <h3>Deploying</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>.nuxt</code> folder is part of the files needed to deploy your SSR application. It is not needed for deploying your static Nuxt app though because we use the <code>dist</code> folder for that.
