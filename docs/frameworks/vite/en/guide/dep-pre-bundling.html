It is done automatically and transparently by default.<section class="level2"aria-labelledby="the-why"><h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2><p>This is Vite performing what we call "dependency pre-bundling". This process serves two purposes:<ol><li><p><strong>CommonJS and UMD compatibility:</strong> During development, Vite's dev serves all code as native ESM. Therefore, Vite must convert dependencies that are shipped as CommonJS or UMD into ESM first.<p>When converting CommonJS dependencies, Vite performs smart import analysis so that named imports to CommonJS modules will work as expected even if the exports are dynamically assigned (e.g. React):<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// works as expected</span>
<span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports"><span class="token maybe-class-name">React</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> useState <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">'react'</span></code></pre><li><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Vite converts ESM dependencies with many internal modules into a single module to improve subsequent page load performance.<p>Some packages ship their ES modules builds as many separate files importing one another. For example, <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/lodash-es/"><code>lodash-es</code> has over 600 internal modules</a>! When we do <code>import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'</code>, the browser fires off 600+ HTTP requests at the same time! Even though the server has no problem handling them, the large amount of requests create a network congestion on the browser side, causing the page to load noticeably slower.<p>By pre-bundling <code>lodash-es</code> into a single module, we now only need one HTTP request instead!</ol>tip NOTE Dependency pre-bundling only applies in development mode, and uses `esbuild` to convert dependencies to ESM. In production builds, `@rollup/plugin-commonjs` is used instead.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="automatic-dependency-discovery"><h2 id="automatic-dependency-discovery">Automatic Dependency Discovery</h2><p>If an existing cache is not found, Vite will crawl your source code and automatically discover dependency imports (i.e. "bare imports" that expect to be resolved from <code>node_modules</code>) and use these found imports as entry points for the pre-bundle. The pre-bundling is performed with <code>esbuild</code> so it's typically very fast.<p>After the server has already started, if a new dependency import is encountered that isn't already in the cache, Vite will re-run the dep bundling process and reload the page if needed.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="monorepos-and-linked-dependencies"><h2 id="monorepos-and-linked-dependencies">Monorepos and Linked Dependencies</h2><p>In a monorepo setup, a dependency may be a linked package from the same repo. Vite automatically detects dependencies that are not resolved from <code>node_modules</code> and treats the linked dep as source code. It will not attempt to bundle the linked dep, and will analyze the linked dep's dependency list instead.<p>However, this requires the linked dep to be exported as ESM. If not, you can add the dependency to <a href="/config/dep-optimization-options.md#optimizedeps-include"><code>optimizeDeps.include</code></a> and <a href="/config/build-options.md#build-commonjsoptions"><code>build.commonjsOptions.include</code></a> in your config.<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword module">default</span> <span class="token function">defineConfig</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>

If you stumble on this issue, use `npm pack` on the linked dependency to fix it.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="customizing-the-behavior"><h2 id="customizing-the-behavior">Customizing the Behavior</h2><p>The default dependency discovery heuristics may not always be desirable. In cases where you want to explicitly include/exclude dependencies from the list, use the <a href="/config/dep-optimization-options.md"><code>optimizeDeps</code> config options</a>.<p>A typical use case for <code>optimizeDeps.include</code> or <code>optimizeDeps.exclude</code> is when you have an import that is not directly discoverable in the source code. For example, maybe the import is created as a result of a plugin transform. This means Vite won't be able to discover the import on the initial scan - it can only discover it after the file is requested by the browser and transformed. This will cause the server to immediately re-bundle after server start.<p>Both <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> can be used to deal with this. If the dependency is large (with many internal modules) or is CommonJS, then you should include it; If the dependency is small and is already valid ESM, you can exclude it and let the browser load it directly.<p>You can further customize esbuild too with the <a href="/config/dep-optimization-options.md#optimizedeps-esbuildoptions"><code>optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions</code> option</a>. For example, adding an esbuild plugin to handle special files in dependencies.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="caching"><h2 id="caching">Caching</h2><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="file-system-cache"><h3 id="file-system-cache">File System Cache</h3><p>Vite caches the pre-bundled dependencies in <code>node_modules/.vite</code>. It determines whether it needs to re-run the pre-bundling step based on a few sources:<ul><li>Package manager lockfile content, e.g. <code>package-lock.json</code>, <code>yarn.lock</code>, <code>pnpm-lock.yaml</code> or <code>bun.lockb</code>.<li>Patches folder modification time.<li>Relevant fields in your <code>vite.config.js</code>, if present.<li><code>NODE_ENV</code> value.</ul><p>The pre-bundling step will only need to be re-run when one of the above has changed.<p>If for some reason you want to force Vite to re-bundle deps, you can either start the dev server with the <code>--force</code> command line option, or manually delete the <code>node_modules/.vite</code> cache directory.</section><section class="level3"aria-labelledby="browser-cache"><h3 id="browser-cache">Browser Cache</h3><p>Resolved dependency requests are strongly cached with HTTP headers <code>max-age=31536000,immutable</code> to improve page reload performance during dev. Once cached, these requests will never hit the dev server again. They are auto invalidated by the appended version query if a different version is installed (as reflected in your package manager lockfile). If you want to debug your dependencies by making local edits, you can:<ol><li>Temporarily disable cache via the Network tab of your browser devtools;<li>Restart Vite dev server with the <code>--force</code> flag to re-bundle the deps;<li>Reload the page. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></ol></section></section></section>
