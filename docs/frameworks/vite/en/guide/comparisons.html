In terms of scope, it's closer to a Preact meta framework, with the same emphasis on compact size as Preact itself. If you are using Preact, WMR is likely going to offer a more fine-tuned experience.</section><section id="webdev-server"class="level2"><h2>@web/dev-server</h2><p><a href="https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/">@web/dev-server</a> (previously <code>es-dev-server</code>) is a great project and Vite 1.0's Koa-based server setup was inspired by it.<p><code>@web/dev-server</code> is a bit lower-level in terms of scope. It does not provide official framework integrations, and requires manually setting up a Rollup configuration for the production build.<p>Overall, Vite is a more opinionated / higher-level tool that aims to provide a more out-of-the-box workflow. That said, the <code>@web</code> umbrella project contains many other excellent tools that may benefit Vite users as well.</section><section id="snowpack"class="level2"><h2>Snowpack</h2><p><a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> was also a no-bundle native ESM dev server, very similar in scope to Vite. The project is no longer being maintained. The Snowpack team is now working on <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, a static site builder powered by Vite. The Astro team is now an active player in the ecosystem, and they are helping to improve Vite.<p>Aside from different implementation details, the two projects shared a lot in terms of technical advantages over traditional tooling. Vite's dependency pre-bundling is also inspired by Snowpack v1 (now <a href="https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/esinstall"><code>esinstall</code></a>). Some of the main differences between the two projects are listed in <a href="https://v2.vitejs.dev/guide/comparisons">the v2 Comparisons Guide</a>. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="./index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
