Forever's simple interface makes it ideal for running smaller deployments of Node.js apps and scripts.<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2":=""target="_blank">PM2</a></strong>: A production process manager for Node.js applications that has a built-in load balancer. PM2 enables you to keep applications alive forever, reloads them without downtime, helps you to manage application logging, monitoring, and clustering.<li><strong><a href="http://strong-pm.io/">StrongLoop Process Manager (Strong-PM)</a></strong>: A production process manager for Node.js applications with built-in load balancing, monitoring, and multi-host deployment. Includes a CLI to build, package, and deploy Node.js applications to a local or remote system.<li><strong>SystemD</strong>: The default process manager on modern Linux distributions, that makes it simple to run a Node application as a service.
