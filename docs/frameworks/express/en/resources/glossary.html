In the context of Express, a program that uses the Express API running on the Node.js platform. Might also refer to an <a href="../api.html#express">app object</a>.</section><section id="api"class="level3"><h3>API</h3><p>Application programming interface. Spell out the abbreviation when it is first used.</section><section id="express"class="level3"><h3>Express</h3><p>A fast, un-opinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js applications. In general, "Express" is preferred to "Express.js," though the latter is acceptable.</section><section id="libuv"class="level3"><h3>libuv</h3><p>A multi-platform support library which focuses on asynchronous I/O, primarily developed for use by Node.js.</section><section id="middleware"class="level3"><h3>middleware</h3><p>A function that is invoked by the Express routing layer before the final request handler, and thus sits in the middle between a raw request and the final intended route. A few fine points of terminology around middleware:<ul><li><code>var foo = require('middleware')</code> is called <em>requiring</em> or <em>using</em> a Node.js module. Then the statement <code>var mw = foo()</code> typically returns the middleware.<li><code>app.use(mw)</code> is called <em>adding the middleware to the global processing stack</em>.<li><code>app.get('/foo', mw, function (req, res) { ... })</code> is called <em>adding the middleware to the "GET /foo" processing stack</em>.</ul></section><section id="nodejs"class="level3"><h3>Node.js</h3><p>A software platform that is used to build scalable network applications. Node.js uses JavaScript as its scripting language, and achieves high throughput via non-blocking I/O and a single-threaded event loop. See <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs.org</a>. <strong>Usage note</strong>: Initially, "Node.js," thereafter "Node".</section><section id="open-source-open-source"class="level3"><h3>open-source, open source</h3><p>When used as an adjective, hyphenate; for example: "This is open-source software." See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open-source software on Wikipedia</a>. Note: Although it is common not to hyphenate this term, we are using the standard English rules for hyphenating a compound adjective.</section><section id="request"class="level3"><h3>request</h3><p>An HTTP request. A client submits an HTTP request message to a server, which returns a response. The request must use one of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">request methods</a> such as GET, POST, and so on.</section><section id="response"class="level3"><h3>response</h3><p>An HTTP response. A server returns an HTTP response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and might also contain requested content in its message body.</section><section id="route"class="level3"><h3>route</h3><p>Part of a URL that identifies a resource. For example, in <code>http://foo.com/products/id</code>, "/products/id" is the route.</section><section id="router"class="level3"><h3>router</h3><p>See <a href="../api.html#router">router</a> in the API reference. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
