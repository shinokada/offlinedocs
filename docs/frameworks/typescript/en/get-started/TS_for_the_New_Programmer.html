The relationship between TypeScript (TS) and JavaScript (JS) is rather unique among modern programming languages, so learning more about this relationship will help you understand how TypeScript adds to JavaScript.<section id="what-is-javascript-a-brief-history"class="level2"><h2>What is JavaScript? A Brief History</h2><p>JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript) started its life as a simple scripting language for browsers. At the time it was invented, it was expected to be used for short snippets of code embedded in a web page — writing more than a few dozen lines of code would have been somewhat unusual. Due to this, early web browsers executed such code pretty slowly. Over time, though, JS became more and more popular, and web developers started using it to create interactive experiences.<p>Web browser developers responded to this increased JS usage by optimizing their execution engines (dynamic compilation) and extending what could be done with it (adding APIs), which in turn made web developers use it even more. On modern websites, your browser is frequently running applications that span hundreds of thousands of lines of code. This is long and gradual growth of "the web", starting as a simple network of static pages, and evolving into a platform for rich <em>applications</em> of all kinds.<p>More than this, JS has become popular enough to be used outside the context of browsers, such as implementing JS servers using node.js. The "run anywhere" nature of JS makes it an attractive choice for cross-platform development. There are many developers these days that use <em>only</em> JavaScript to program their entire stack!<p>To summarize, we have a language that was designed for quick uses, and then grew to a full-fledged tool to write applications with millions of lines. Every language has its own <em>quirks</em> — oddities and surprises, and JavaScript's humble beginning makes it have <em>many</em> of these. Some examples:<ul><li><p>JavaScript's equality operator (<code>==</code>) <em>coerces</em> its arguments, leading to unexpected behavior:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword control-flow">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">""</span> <span class="token operator">==</span> <span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// It is! But why??</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token keyword control-flow">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token operator">&#x3C;</span> x <span class="token operator">&#x3C;</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// True for *any* value of x!</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><li><p>JavaScript also allows accessing properties which aren't present:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> obj <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token literal-property property">width</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token literal-property property">height</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">15</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token comment">// Why is this NaN? Spelling is hard!</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> area <span class="token operator">=</span> obj<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">width</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> obj<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">heigth</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre></ul><p>Most programming languages would throw an error when these sorts of errors occur, some would do so during compilation — before any code is running. When writing small programs, such quirks are annoying but manageable; when writing applications with hundreds or thousands of lines of code, these constant surprises are a serious problem.</section><section id="typescript-a-static-type-checker"class="level2"><h2>TypeScript: A Static Type Checker</h2><p>We said earlier that some languages wouldn't allow those buggy programs to run at all. Detecting errors in code without running it is referred to as <em>static checking</em>. Determining what's an error and what's not based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static <em>type</em> checking.<p>TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the <em>kinds of values</em>, it's a <em>static type checker</em>. For example, the last example above has an error because of the <em>type</em> of <code>obj</code>. Here's the error TypeScript found:<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// @errors: 2551</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> obj <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> width<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> height<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">15</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> area <span class="token operator">=</span> obj<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">width</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> obj<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">heigth</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><section id="a-typed-superset-of-javascript"class="level3"><h3>A Typed Superset of JavaScript</h3><p>How does TypeScript relate to JavaScript, though?<section id="syntax"class="level4"><h4>Syntax</h4><p>TypeScript is a language that is a <em>superset</em> of JavaScript: JS syntax is therefore legal TS. Syntax refers to the way we write text to form a program. For example, this code has a <em>syntax</em> error because it's missing a <code>)</code>:<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// @errors: 1005</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">4</span></code></pre><p>TypeScript doesn't consider any JavaScript code to be an error because of its syntax. This means you can take any working JavaScript code and put it in a TypeScript file without worrying about exactly how it is written.</section><section id="types"class="level4"><h4>Types</h4><p>However, TypeScript is a <em>typed</em> superset, meaning that it adds rules about how different kinds of values can be used. The earlier error about <code>obj.heigth</code> was not a <em>syntax</em> error: it is an error of using some kind of value (a <em>type</em>) in an incorrect way.<p>As another example, this is JavaScript code that you can run in your browser, and it <em>will</em> log a value:<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token console class-name">console</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">4</span> <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>This syntactically-legal program logs <code>Infinity</code>. TypeScript, though, considers division of number by an array to be a nonsensical operation, and will issue an error:<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token comment">// @errors: 2363</span>
<span class="token console class-name">console</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">4</span> <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>It's possible you really <em>did</em> intend to divide a number by an array, perhaps just to see what happens, but most of the time, though, this is a programming mistake. TypeScript's type checker is designed to allow correct programs through while still catching as many common errors as possible. (Later, we'll learn about settings you can use to configure how strictly TypeScript checks your code.)<p>If you move some code from a JavaScript file to a TypeScript file, you might see <em>type errors</em> depending on how the code is written. These may be legitimate problems with the code, or TypeScript being overly conservative. Throughout this guide we'll demonstrate how to add various TypeScript syntax to eliminate such errors.</section><section id="runtime-behavior"class="level4"><h4>Runtime Behavior</h4><p>TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the <em>runtime behavior</em> of JavaScript. For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript produces <code>Infinity</code> instead of throwing a runtime exception. As a principle, TypeScript <strong>never</strong> changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.<p>This means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is <strong>guaranteed</strong> to run the same way, even if TypeScript thinks that the code has type errors.<p>Keeping the same runtime behavior as JavaScript is a foundational promise of TypeScript because it means you can easily transition between the two languages without worrying about subtle differences that might make your program stop working.</section><section id="erased-types"class="level4"><h4>Erased Types</h4><p>Roughly speaking, once TypeScript's compiler is done with checking your code, it <em>erases</em> the types to produce the resulting "compiled" code. This means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain JS code has no type information.<p>This also means that TypeScript never changes the <em>behavior</em> of your program based on the types it inferred. The bottom line is that while you might see type errors during compilation, the type system itself has no bearing on how your program works when it runs.<p>Finally, TypeScript doesn't provide any additional runtime libraries. Your programs will use the same standard library (or external libraries) as JavaScript programs, so there's no additional TypeScript-specific framework to learn.</section></section></section><section id="learning-javascript-and-typescript"class="level2"><h2>Learning JavaScript and TypeScript</h2><p>We frequently see the question "Should I learn JavaScript or TypeScript?".<p>The answer is that you can't learn TypeScript without learning JavaScript! TypeScript shares syntax and runtime behavior with JavaScript, so anything you learn about JavaScript is helping you learn TypeScript at the same time.<p>There are many, many resources available for programmers to learn JavaScript; you should <em>not</em> ignore these resources if you're writing TypeScript. For example, there are about 20 times more StackOverflow questions tagged <code>javascript</code> than <code>typescript</code>, but <em>all</em> of the <code>javascript</code> questions also apply to TypeScript.<p>If you find yourself searching for something like "how to sort a list in TypeScript", remember: <strong>TypeScript is JavaScript's runtime with a compile-time type checker</strong>. The way you sort a list in TypeScript is the same way you do so in JavaScript. If you find a resource that uses TypeScript directly, that's great too, but don't limit yourself to thinking you need TypeScript-specific answers for everyday questions about how to accomplish runtime tasks.</section><section id="next-steps"class="level2"><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>This was a brief overview of the syntax and tools used in everyday TypeScript.
