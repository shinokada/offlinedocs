Svelte provides the <code>@sveltejs/enhanced-image</code> package, detailed on the <a href="images">images</a> page, for making this easier. Additionally, Lighthouse is useful for identifying the worst offenders.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="videos"><h2 id="videos">Videos</h2><p>Video files can be very large, so extra care should be taken to ensure that they're optimized:<ul><li>Compress videos with tools such as <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>. Consider converting the videos to web-friendly formats such as <code>.webm</code> or <code>.mp4</code>.<li>You can <a href="https://web.dev/articles/lazy-loading-video">lazy-load videos</a> located below the fold with <code>preload="none"</code> (though note that this will slow down playback when the user <em>does</em> initiate it).<li>Strip the audio track out of muted videos using a tool like <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>.</ul></section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="fonts"><h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2><p>SvelteKit automatically preloads critical <code>.js</code> and <code>.css</code> files when the user visits a page, but it does <em>not</em> preload fonts by default, since this may cause unnecessary files (such as font weights that are referenced by your CSS but not actually used on the current page) to be downloaded. Having said that, preloading fonts correctly can make a big difference to how fast your site feels. In your <a href="hooks#server-hooks-handle"><code>handle</code></a> hook, you can call <code>resolve</code> with a <code>preload</code> filter that includes your fonts.<p>You can reduce the size of font files by <a href="https://web.dev/learn/performance/optimize-web-fonts#subset_your_web_fonts">subsetting</a> your fonts.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="reducing-code-size"><h2 id="reducing-code-size">Reducing code size</h2></section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="svelte-version"><h2 id="svelte-version">Svelte version</h2><p>We recommend running the latest version of Svelte. Svelte 4 is smaller and faster than Svelte 3. (The <a href="https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/">Svelte 5 preview</a> is much smaller and faster still, but we don't recommend that you upgrade to this version until it's production ready.)</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="packages"><h2 id="packages">Packages</h2><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-visualizer"><code>rollup-plugin-visualizer</code></a> can be helpful for identifying which packages are contributing the most to the size of your site. You may also find opportunities to remove code by manually inspecting the build output (use <code>build: { minify: false }</code> in your <a href="https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-minify">Vite config</a> to make the output readable, but remember to undo that before deploying your app), or via the network tab of your browser's devtools.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="external-scripts"><h2 id="external-scripts">External scripts</h2><p>Try to minimize the number of third-party scripts running in the browser. For example, instead of using JavaScript-based analytics consider using server-side implementations, such as those offered by many platforms with SvelteKit adapters including <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/">Cloudflare</a>, <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/site-analytics/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/analytics">Vercel</a>.<p>To run third party scripts in a web worker (which avoids blocking the main thread), use <a href="https://partytown.builder.io/sveltekit">Partytown's SvelteKit integration</a>.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="selective-loading"><h2 id="selective-loading">Selective loading</h2><p>Code imported with static <code>import</code> declarations will be automatically bundled with the rest of your page. If there is a piece of code you need only when some condition is met, use the dynamic <code>import(...)</code> form to selectively lazy-load the component.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="navigation"><h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2></section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="preloading"><h2 id="preloading">Preloading</h2><p>You can speed up client-side navigations by eagerly preloading the necessary code and data, using <a href="link-options">link options</a>. This is configured by default on the <code>&#x3C;body></code> element when you create a new SvelteKit app.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="non-essential-data"><h2 id="non-essential-data">Non-essential data</h2><p>For slow-loading data that isn't needed immediately, the object returned from your <code>load</code> function can contain promises rather than the data itself. For server <code>load</code> functions, this will cause the data to <a href="load#streaming-with-promises">stream</a> in after the navigation (or initial page load).</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="preventing-waterfalls"><h2 id="preventing-waterfalls">Preventing waterfalls</h2><p>One of the biggest performance killers is what is referred to as a <em>waterfall</em>, which is a series of requests that is made sequentially. This can happen on the server or in the browser.<ul><li>Asset waterfalls can occur in the browser when your HTML requests JS which requests CSS which requests a background image and web font. SvelteKit will largely solve this class of problems for you by adding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/modulepreload"><code>modulepreload</code></a> tags or headers, but you should view <a href="#diagnosing-issues">the network tab in your devtools</a> to check whether additional resources need to be preloaded. Pay special attention to this if you use web <a href="#optimizing-assets-fonts">fonts</a> since they need to be handled manually.<li>If a universal <code>load</code> function makes an API call to fetch the current user, then uses the details from that response to fetch a list of saved items, and then uses <em>that</em> response to fetch the details for each item, the browser will end up making multiple sequential requests. This is deadly for performance, especially for users that are physically located far from your backend. Avoid this issue by using <a href="../20-core-concepts/20-load.html#universal-vs-server">server <code>load</code> functions</a> where possible.<li>Server <code>load</code> functions are also not immune to waterfalls (though they are much less costly since they rarely involve roundtrips with high latency). For example if you query a database to get the current user and then use that data to make a second query for a list of saved items, it will typically be more performant to issue a single query with a database join.</ul></section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="hosting"><h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2><p>Your frontend should be located in the same data center as your backend to minimize latency. For sites with no central backend, many SvelteKit adapters support deploying to the <em>edge</em>, which means handling each user's requests from a nearby server. This can reduce load times significantly. Some adapters even support <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev../20-core-concepts/40-page-options.html#config">configuring deployment on a per-route basis</a>. You should also consider serving images from a CDN (which are typically edge networks) — the hosts for many SvelteKit adapters will do this automatically.<p>Ensure your host uses HTTP/2 or newer. Vite's code splitting creates numerous small files for improved cacheability, which results in excellent performance, but this does assume that your files can be loaded in parallel with HTTP/2.</section><section class="level2"aria-labelledby="further-reading"><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2><p>For the most part, building a performant SvelteKit app is the same as building any performant web app. You should be able to apply information from general performance resources such as <a href="https://web.dev/explore/learn-core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a> to any web experience you build. <span style="float:footnote"><a href="../../index.html#toc">Go to TOC</a></span></section></section>
