They work pretty well for making nice slides with animations, charts, and many other things, while being very intuitive and easy to learn. So why bother making Slidev?<p>Slidev aims to provide the flexibility and interactivity for developers to make their presentations even more interesting, expressive, and attractive by using the tools and technologies they are already familiar with.<p>When working with WYSIWYG editors, it is easy to get distracted by the styling options. Slidev remedies that by separating the content and visuals. This allows you to focus on one thing at a time, while also being able to reuse the themes from the community. Slidev does not seek to replace other slide deck builders entirely. Rather, it focuses on catering to the developer community.<section id="slidev"class="level2"><h2>Slidev</h2><p><img src="../public/cover.png"><p>Here are a few of the coolest features of Slidev:</section><section id="markdown-based"class="level2"><h2>Markdown-based</h2><p>Slidev uses an extended Markdown format to store and organize your slides in a single plain text file.
